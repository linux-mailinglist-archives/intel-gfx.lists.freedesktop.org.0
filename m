Yeah, it is nothing really new but it also doesn't mean it is an example
worth following as this doesn't really work currently. Also please note
that MM_SHMEMPAGES is counting at least something process specific as
those pages are mapped in to the process (and with enough of wishful
thinking unmapping can drop the last reference and free something up
actually) . With generic per-file memory this is even more detached from
process.

I am not sure what would be the proper way to control that that would be
future extensible. Kernel command line is certainly and option but if we
want to extend that to module like or eBPF interface then it wouldn't
stand a future test very quickly.

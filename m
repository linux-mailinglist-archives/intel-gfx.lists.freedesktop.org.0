Matt explained the issue offline to me (it would have helped to explain the
reason for the patch in the commit message). The issue is that in uses of
for_each_gt such as below (there are others too in the PMU code):

        for_each_gt(gt, i915, i) {
                intel_wakeref_t wakeref;

                with_intel_runtime_pm(gt->uncore->rpm, wakeref) {
                        u64 val = __get_rc6(gt);

                        store_sample(pmu, i, __I915_SAMPLE_RC6, val);
                        store_sample(pmu, i, __I915_SAMPLE_RC6_LAST_REPORTED,
                                     val);
                        pmu->sleep_last[i] = ktime_get_raw();
                }
        }

static checkers are complaining that for_each_gt can read/write outside the
bounds of PMU arrays. Because absent gt's will be NULL in for_each_gt this
cannot really happen but we still need to keep static checkers happy.

So to resolve this issue we need I915_PMU_MAX_GTS and I915_MAX_GT to have
the same value. So either we need to increase I915_PMU_MAX_GTS to 4 or
reduce I915_MAX_GT to 2.

Ashutosh

That sounds reasonable to me.  But it's basically the i915 stuff, so
I'd leave the decision to you guys :)

My another quick thought after reading this mail is whether we can
simply remove glk_force_audio_cdclk(false) in
i915_audio_component_put_power().  In this way, a flicker should be
reduced, at most only once at boot time, and the CDCLK is lowered only
when the audio is really used (once).

Or, similarly, it can be put into *_component_bind() and *_unbind()
instead of *_get_power() and *_put_power().  This indicates that the
corresponding audio device really exists.


thanks,

Takashi

Hi All,

Here is hopefully the last version of this series, as everything seems
to be ready for merging this now.

The only difference from v9 is correcting some mistakes in the commit-msg of:
[PATCH v10 06/17] pwm: lpss: Make pwm_lpss_apply() not rely on hardware state

I plan is to push the entire series to drm-intel-next-queued
(because of interdependencies) once the series has passed CI.

This series has been tested (and re-tested after adding various bug-fixes)
extensively. It has been tested on the following devices:

-Asus T100TA  BYT + CRC-PMIC PWM
-Toshiba WT8-A  BYT + CRC-PMIC PWM
-Thundersoft TS178  BYT + CRC-PMIC PWM, inverse PWM
-Asus T100HA  CHT + CRC-PMIC PWM
-Terra Pad 1061  BYT + LPSS PWM
-Trekstor Twin 10.1  BYT + LPSS PWM
-Asus T101HA  CHT + LPSS PWM
-GPD Pocket  CHT + LPSS PWM
-Acer One S1003  CHT + LPSS PWM

Regards,

Hans


Changelog:

Changes in v10:
- Fixup the commit msg of:
  [PATCH v10 06/17] pwm: lpss: Make pwm_lpss_apply() not rely on hardware state

Changes in v9:
- Replace:
  [PATCH v8 06/17] pwm: lpss: Use pwm_lpss_restore() when restoring state on resume
  [PATCH v8 07/17] pwm: lpss: Always update state and set update bit
  with:
  [PATCH v9 06/17] pwm: lpss: Make pwm_lpss_apply() not rely on hardware state
  [PATCH v9 07/17] pwm: lpss: Remove suspend/resume handlers

Changes in v8:
- Add a new patch dealing with the ACPI/DSDT GFX0._PS3 code poking the PWM controller
  in unexpected ways on some Cherry Trail devices

Changes in v7:
- Fix a u64 divide leading to undefined reference to `__udivdi3' errors on 32 bit
  platforms by casting the divisor to an unsigned long

Changes in v6:
- Rebase on v5.9-rc1
- Adjust pwm-crc patches for pwm_state.period and .duty_cycle now being u64

Changes in v5:
- Dropped the "pwm: lpss: Correct get_state result for base_unit == 0"
  patch. The base_unit == 0 condition should never happen and sofar it is
  unclear what the proper behavior / correct values to store in the
  pwm_state should be when this does happen.  Since this patch was added as
  an extra pwm-lpss fix in v4 of this patch-set and otherwise is orthogonal
  to the of this patch-set just drop it (again).
- "[PATCH 04/16] pwm: lpss: Add range limit check for the base_unit register value"
  - Use clamp_val(... instead of clam_t(unsigned long long, ...
- "[PATCH 05/16] pwm: lpss: Add pwm_lpss_prepare_enable() helper"
  - This is a new patch in v5 of this patchset
- [PATCH 06/16] pwm: lpss: Use pwm_lpss_apply() when restoring state on resume
  - Use the new pwm_lpss_prepare_enable() helper

Changes in v4:
- "[PATCH v4 06/16] pwm: lpss: Correct get_state result for base_unit == 0"
  - This is a new patch in v4 of this patchset
- "[PATCH v4 12/16] pwm: crc: Implement get_state() method"
  - Use DIV_ROUND_UP when calculating the period and duty_cycle values
- "[PATCH v4 16/16] drm/i915: panel: Use atomic PWM API for devs with an external PWM controller"
  - Add a note to the commit message about the changes in pwm_disable_backlight()
  - Use the pwm_set/get_relative_duty_cycle() helpers

Changes in v3:
- "[PATCH v3 04/15] pwm: lpss: Add range limit check for the base_unit register value"
  - Use base_unit_range - 1 as maximum value for the clamp()
- "[PATCH v3 05/15] pwm: lpss: Use pwm_lpss_apply() when restoring state on resume"
  - This replaces the "pwm: lpss: Set SW_UPDATE bit when enabling the PWM"
    patch from previous versions of this patch-set, which really was a hack
    working around the resume issue which this patch fixes properly.
- PATCH v3 6 - 11 pwm-crc changes:
  - Various small changes resulting from the reviews by Andy and Uwe,
    including some refactoring of the patches to reduce the amount of churn
    in the patch-set

Changes in v2:
- Fix coverletter subject
- Drop accidentally included debugging patch
- "[PATCH v3 02/15] ACPI / LPSS: Save Cherry Trail PWM ctx registers only once (
  - Move #define LPSS_SAVE_CTX_ONCE define to group it with LPSS_SAVE_CTX

I just realized that your have vendor driver unregister
the native one is suggested as an alternative for
the new behavior where the i915 driver no longer
registers its native backlight in cases where
acpi_video_get_backlight_type() does not return native,
and that you probably actually want the native backlight
device, right ?

So the above should read:

"so that acpi_video_get_backlight_type() just always
returns native there."

I guess it is weird in that it does not have the ACPI video,
or at least does not offer ACPI video bus backlight control
in its ACPI tables?

Can you perhaps email me an acpidump of the laptop ?

And this bit can be ignored then because it certainly
is not relevant if you actually want the native driver.

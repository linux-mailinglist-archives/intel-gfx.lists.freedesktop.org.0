Thanks Rodrigo for the inputs. I agree with you in terms of not having
this for all patches. But particularly this patch was a suggestion that
came up through our offline discussion.
And in cases like this it is a good idea to be mindful about and give
respectful credits. For internal folks its not a big deal, but
Just want to make sure we dont lose the credibility in the community if
this is missed for external folks. People do spend time reviewing and
suggesting and improving codebase so it is good to be respectful and add
the tags for patches that are entirely someone else's suggestion.

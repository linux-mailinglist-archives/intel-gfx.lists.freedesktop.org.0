IMO if the elimination of implicit dev_priv is not included then I am 
not sure the churn is worth the effort.

I think one trap is that it is easy to assume solving those conflicts is 
easy because there is a script, somewhere, whatever, but one needs to be 
careful with assuming a random person hitting a merge conflict will 
realize there is a script, know where to find it, and know how to use it 
against a state where conflict markers are sitting in their local tree. 
That's a lot of assumed knowledge which my experience tells me is not 
universally there.

Having said all that, I looked at the occurrence histogram for the 
proposed churn and gut feel says conflicts wouldn't even be that bad 
since they seem heavily localized in a handful of files plus the display 
subdir.

Plus it is upstream.. so we are allowed not to care too much about 
backporting woes. I would still hope implicit dev_priv, albeit 
orthogonal, would be coming somewhat together with the rename. For that 
warm fuzzy feeling that the churn was really really worth it.

Tvrtko

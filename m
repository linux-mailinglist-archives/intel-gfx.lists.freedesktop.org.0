Hi Ville,

Thank you so much for this incredible series.
It solves the issue regarding MTL initial plane readout
that Andrzej Hajda and I worked on in
https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/570811/?series=127130&rev=2
In addition, it solved the issue with the new GOP.

I tested it on two different devices with Meteor Lake and it worked perfectly:
no i915 errors, no flickers or observable issues.

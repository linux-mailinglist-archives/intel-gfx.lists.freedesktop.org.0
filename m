But without my patch which nid gets "power state: 0" and external type-c monitor flashes once after playing music. Assume my finding is right, do we have chance to submit code to fix issue? Thanks.

Is the issue reproduced with the latest upstream code (or at least
5.4.y stable)?
Then yeah, we need to take a deeper look.


thanks,

Takashi

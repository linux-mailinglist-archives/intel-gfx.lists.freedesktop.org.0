All vendor drivers that I'm aware of have:

	if (acpi_video_get_backlight_type() != acpi_backlight_vendor)
		return;

In their backlight register paths and this has been present since
circa 2015.

So both before and after my 6.1 refactor vendor is only preferred
on devices which don't implement the ACPI video bus control method.

I see. I agree that preferring native over vendor on machines
which do not have ACPI video backlight control will cause issues
on older machines. Avoiding this scenario is exactly why currently
the native check is conditional on the presence of ACPI video
backlight control.

I wish that that ("telling you whether they'd prefer vendor or native")
were true. But that does not match my experience at all and I've been
working on making the kernel pick the right backlight interface on
laptops since 2014.

Just because a vendor interface is present does not mean that it will
work. Unfortunately for none of the 3 main native/acpi_video/vendor
backlight control methods the control method being present also guarantees
that it will work. Which completely sucks, but it is the reality we
have to deal with.

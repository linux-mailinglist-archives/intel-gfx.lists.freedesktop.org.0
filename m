That's just because we don't need to do anything to the 
bw state unless some crtc is doing stuff.

intel_atomic_get_new_bw_state() is never called from a loop
like that. At least I can't immediately see a single place
where that would happen.

And there is no guarantee anyway that a crtc being part
of the commit would imply that bw state is also included.
The crtc could have been added to the commit after the
code ran which adds the bw state.

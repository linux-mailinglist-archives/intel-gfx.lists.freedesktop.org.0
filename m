Can we include a reference to this part of the ACPI spec and some
details on which laptops have this issue?

I'm a little bit wary of changing the PCI core in a generic-looking
way on the basis of some unspecified buggy old BIOS.  That feels like
something we're likely to break in the future.

Thanks, this feels like important history to include somewhere.

I'm all in favor of removing pci_save_state() from drivers when
possible.  I take it that this doesn't fix a functional issue.

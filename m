Briefly, and also looked around how it is used. I don't immediately 
understand which part concerns you and it is also quite possible I am 
missing something.

But see for example how it is used in intel_context.c+intel_lrc.c to 
protect the context state object from the shrinker while it is in use by 
the GPU. It does not appear any black magic is required.

Question also is does that kind of lifetime aligns with the DPT use case.

I also see who added that one! ;)

Oops - i915_vma_make_(un)shrinkable.

Anyway, I think it is worth giving it a try if the DPT lifetimes makes 
it possible.

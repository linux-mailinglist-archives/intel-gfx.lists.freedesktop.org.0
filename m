Allow a brief period for continued access to a dead intel_context by
deferring the release of the struct until after an RCU grace period.
As we are using a dedicated slab cache for the contexts, we can defer
the release of the slab pages via RCU, with the caveat that individual
structs may be reused from the freelist within an RCU grace period. To
handle that, we have to avoid clearing members of the zombie struct.

This is required for a later patch to handle locking around virtual
requests in the signaler, as those requests may want to move between
engines and be destroyed while we are holding b->irq_lock on a physical
engine.

v2: Drop mutex_reinit(), if we never mark the mutex as destroyed we
don't need to reset the debug code, at the loss of having the mutex
debug code spot us attempting to destroy a locked mutex.
v3: As the intended use will remain strongly referenced counted, with
very little inflight access across reuse, drop the ctor.
v4: Drop the unrequired change to remove the temporary reference around
dropping the active context, and add back some more missing ctor
operations.
v5: The ctor is back. Tvrtko spotted that ce->signal_lock [introduced
later] maybe accessed under RCU and so needs special care not to be
reinitialised.
v6: Don't mix SLAB_TYPESAFE_BY_RCU and RCU list iteration.

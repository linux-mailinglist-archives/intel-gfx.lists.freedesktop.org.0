Yes, I do not think you can make per-process accounting without a
concept of the per-process ownership.

I would say memcg, but we have discussed this already...

I do not think that exposing a resource (in a form of a counter
or something like that) is sufficient. The existing oom killer
implementation is hevily process centric (with memcg extension for
grouping but not changing the overall design in principle). If you
want to make it aware of resources which are not directly accounted to
processes then a a new implementation is necessary IMHO. You would need
to evaluate those resources and kill all the tasks that can hold on that
resource.

This is also the reason why I am not really fan of the per file
badness because it adds a notion of resource that is not process bound
in general so it will add all sorts of weird runtime corner cases which
are impossible to anticipate [*]. Maybe that will work in some scenarios
but definitely not something to be done by default without users opting
into that and being aware of consequences. 

There have been discussions that the existing oom implementation cannot
fit all potential usecases so maybe we need to finally decide to use a
plugable, BPFable etc architecture allow implementations that fit
specific needs.

[*] I know it is not directly related but kinda similar. In the past
we used to have heuristics to consider work done as a resource . That is
kill younger processes preferably to reduce the damage.  This has turned
out to have a very unpredictable behavior and many complains by
users. Situation has improved when the selection was solely based on
rss. This has its own cons of course but at least they are predictable.

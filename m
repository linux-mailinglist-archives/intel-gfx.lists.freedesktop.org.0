Looks like in this case the file name is ok but the problem is with the
description (which does not correspond to what PL1 is). Will fix.

Yes looks like this might work for TDP. We will consider this.

'default TDP' (RO) and 'TDP' (RO) are the same but PL1 is somewhat
different from TDP (see the first link above) and also I believe chip
makers specify PL1 and TDP separately (as in this case).

OK, in that case would a custom setting for Tau also be ok?

OK, I believe you are referring to 9049572fb145. Will keep this in mind too.

Thanks.

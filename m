This is orthogonal to my display ptr refactoring and should probably
be applied first.

The display funcs vtable was a bit of mess, lots of intermixing of
internal display functionality and interfaces to watermarks/irqs.

It's also considered not great security practice to leave writeable
function pointers around for exploits to get into.

This series attempts to address both problems, first there are a
few cleanups, then it splits the function table into multiple pieces.
Some of the splits might be bikesheds but I think we should apply first
and merge things later if there is good reason.

The second half converts all the vtables to static const structs,
I've used macros in some of them to make it less messy, the cdclk
one is probably the worst one.

Dave.

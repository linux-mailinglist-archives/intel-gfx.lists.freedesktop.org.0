Checkpatch does suffer from the limitations of regular expressions. But 
that doesn't stop people from using it. Besides, Coccinelle can do 
analyses that can't be done with regular expressions, so it's moot.

Logic errors of this kind are susceptible to fuzzing, formal methods, 
symbolic execution etc. No doubt there are other techniques that I don't 
know about.

Provably equivalent conversions are provably churn. So apparently you're 
advocating changes that are not provably equivalent.

These are patches for code not that's not been shown to be buggy. Code 
which, after patching, can be shown to be free of a specific kind of 
theoretical bug. Hardly "provably correct".

The problem is, the class of theoretical bugs that can be avoided in this 
way is probably limitless, as is the review cost and the risk of 
accidental regressions. And the payoff is entirely theoretical.

Moreover, the patch review workload for skilled humans is being generated 
by the automation, which is completely backwards: the machine is supposed 
to be helping.

Now that the tasklet completely controls scheduling of the requests, and
we postpone scheduling out the old requests, we can keep a hanging
virtual request bound to the engine on which it hung, and remove it from
te queue. On release, it will be returned to the same engine and remain
in its queue until it is scheduled; after which point it will become
eligible for transfer to a sibling. Instead, we could opt to resubmit the
request along the virtual engine on unhold, making it eligible for load
balancing immediately -- but that seems like a pointless optimisation
for a hanging context.

I got some results from the promised comparison between the dual-ELSP
utilization approach used in this series and the more obvious
alternative of keeping track of the time that any request (or context)
is in flight.  As expected there are quite a few performance
improvements (numbers relative to this approach), however most of them
are either synthetic benchmarks or off-screen variants of benchmarks
(the corresponding on-screen variant of each benchmark below doesn't
show a significant improvement):

There aren't as many regressions (numbers relative to upstream
linux-next kernel), they're mostly 2D test-cases, however they are
substantially worse in absolute value:

There are some things we might be able to do to get some of the
additional improvement we can see above without hurting
latency-sensitive workloads, but it's going to take more effort, the
present approach of using the dual-ELSP utilization seems like a good
compromise to me for starters.

Ok, so the plan now is to just post and review/merge the first 4 patches
mostly as is, except that the poll timer cannot be disabled. IMO this
should solve the cpu usage issue. Then we can take up the remaining 3
interrupt and flush patches and see if they are really needed and move them
forward if they are.

I think you mean over-written. You are right but I think there is way
around this and we can post that patch soon which I think will avoid this
issue too.

Thanks!

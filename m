Correct, so no changes needed for stable kernels. But going forward Badal
is proposing (which I sort of agree with but may need some discussion) that
we change i915 behavior to return 0 freq (instead of cur_freq or RPn) when
GT is idle or in RC6 (so we don't take forcewake to read freq when GT is in
RC6).

Agree!

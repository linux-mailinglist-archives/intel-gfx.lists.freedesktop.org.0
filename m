I have no strong opinion on this one. In my mind I categorised it under 
"is it a large framebuffer" heuristics. Previously it was less than one 
half of aperture always okay, now one quarter, plus 2x hole check if 
larger. Both are heuristics. I even mentioned earlier if 2x should be an 
input parameter as well, but again, given it's not an exported function 
couldn't really justify it.

It's not exported though, maybe remove i915_gem prefix to avoid any 
ideas of it being generic?

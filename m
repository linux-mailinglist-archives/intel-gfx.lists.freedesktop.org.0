I just plotted the same results from the cover letter in separate
performance and energy efficiency graphs:

I'll work on a better commit message for v2.

Ultimately what we're trying to determine here is whether the
performance of the graphics workload is sensitive to the latency of the
CPU -- If it is we don't want to place a response latency constraint.
If the two ELSP ports are in use somewhere close to 100% of the time we
know that for most of the run-time of the workload the completion of one
request leads to the immediate execution of another, which means that
the GPU can be kept busy without the execlists submission code rushing
to submit a new requestt, so latency isn't a concern.

Looking at the number of runnable contexts is very close but not exactly
equivalent to that, since the workload may still be latency-sensitive if
the multiple contexts are only being submitted to a single port.

In the GuC submission case the CPU doesn't need to get involved to
submit the next piece of work (unless there is some cyclical dependency
between CPU and GPU work that is), so it should be sufficient to look at
whether at least one port is active -- Also even while using execlists,
there are applications which are able to keep some GPU engine busy
nearly 100% of the time (meaning that their performance won't increase
with decreasing latency since the engine can hardly do more work than
that), but they are unable to keep the two ELSP ports busy for some
significant fraction of that time, so it would be more accurate for them
to use the single-port utilization as heuristic (which yeah, is also
roughly equivalent to the fraction of time that at least one runnable
context or request was pending execution), at a cost for the
applications that are actually sensitive to the ELSP submission latency
we would be neglecting.

This patch takes the rather conservative approach of limiting the
application of the response frequency PM QoS request to the more
restrictive set of cases where we are most certain that CPU latency
shouldn't be an issue, in order to avoid regressions.  But it might be
that you find the additional energy efficiency benefit from the more
aggressive approach to be worth the cost to a few execlists submission
latency-sensitive applications.  I'm trying to get some numbers
comparing the two approaches now, will post them here once I have
results so we can make a more informed trade-off.

Sure, I'll see what I can come up with.

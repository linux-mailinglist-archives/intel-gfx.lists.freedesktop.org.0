The goal of the statistics calculation code introduced here is to
compute two informational data structures: struct vlp_input_stats
aggregating various scheduling and PM statistics gathered in every
call of the update_util() hook, and struct vlp_status_sample which
contains status information derived from the former indicating whether
the system is likely to have an IO or CPU bottleneck.  This will be
used as main heuristic input by the new variably low-pass filtering
controller (AKA VLP) that will assist the HWP at finding a reasonably
energy-efficient P-state given the additional information available to
the kernel about I/O utilization and scheduling behavior.

Then a function is introduced (get_vlp_target_range()) which
calculates a P-state range derived from those statistics, which will
be used to drive the HWP P-state range or (if HWP is not available) as
basis for some additional kernel-side frequency selection mechanism
which will choose a single P-state from the range.  This is meant to
provide a variably low-pass filtering effect that will damp
oscillations below a frequency threshold that can be specified by
device drivers via PM QoS in order to achieve energy-efficient
behavior in cases where the system has an IO bottleneck.

v3: Rename CPU_RESPONSE_FREQUENCY to CPU_SCALING_RESPONSE (Rafael).
    Merge patch with statistics calculations with patch which computes
    a derived P-state target based on their result (Rafael).  Define
    generic CPUFREQ policy to control VLP governor (Rafael).  Adjust
    realtime_gain_pml to avoid fluctuation of minimum P-state on HWP
    parts (Srinivas).

+	 *    response.
+	 *
+	 *  - The period of the oscillating workload is significantly
+	 *    shorter than the time constant of the exponential

+	 *    more slowly oscillating workloads the controller
+	 *    response will roughly follow the oscillation, leading to

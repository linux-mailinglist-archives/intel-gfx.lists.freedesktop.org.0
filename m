I would make this two patches:

  1) Add static locals to all QFLAG_APPLY_ONCE quirks and remove
     QFLAG_APPLY_ONCE etc.  This patch is mechanical and shouldn't
     break or fix anything.

  2) Update the intel graphics quirk to change the way it sets the
     static local.  Make the subject be something about fixing the
     problem with Intel integrated + discrete graphics.

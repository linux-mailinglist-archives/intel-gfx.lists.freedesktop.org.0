I think the patch commit message should clearly state the reason for the
patch. Afais if the purpose of the patch is to reduce cpu overhead, the
patch should not change API behavior. If on the other hand the purpose of
the patch is to make the API behavior consistent, then please resubmit the
patch after modifying the commit message to reflect the purpose of the
patch so that the patch can be reviewed from that point of view.

Also I think we should be able to just use stream->pollin instead of
defining the new oa_buffer_check_reports(). E.g. isn't
stream->pollin == (stream->oa_buffer.tail != stream->oa_buffer.head) ?

Thanks!

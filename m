 From the process standpoint strictly yes, but in practice I think there 
is no rush.

The ones which got merged I definitely do not like are:

Rc6 - because it creates an inconsistency where rc6p remains a device 
info flag.

DDI - because it is not 100% trivial and used from i915_irq.c. But a) I 
am not sure it is truly on an irq path, and b) it is display code so not 
my call anyway. (Affects the DP MST one as well by inheritance.)

The others are at best lukewarm to me - primarily because I am not 
convinced there is a benefit to it all. One day the need might come to 
move them back if some platforms drops support or something, which would 
be more churn. And it is handy to see a consolidated description of a 
platform in dmesg when looking at bugs. So just not sure it's an 
improvement.

Give there is much more conversions proposed I guess it may make sense 
to revert until overall consensus is achieved, since it may be odd to 
have a handful if we decide to stop there.

Tvrtko

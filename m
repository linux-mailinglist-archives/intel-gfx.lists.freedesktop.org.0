See Daniele's comment here:

https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/478856/?series=101551&rev=1

We clean up the gt sysfs during PCI device remove (i915_driver_remove ->
i915_driver_unregister -> intel_gt_driver_unregister ->
intel_gt_sysfs_unregister (added in this patch)). But from Daniele's mail
it appears that "kfree(gt)" can only be done from i915_driver_release().

So as long as i915_driver_release() always happens after
i915_driver_remove() (which seems to be the case though I couldn't figure
out why (i.e. who is putting the final reference of the drm device)) there
is no UAF and no race. Thanks!

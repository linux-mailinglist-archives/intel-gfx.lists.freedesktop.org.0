Yes, sure. Looks like none of the previous i915 sysfs (even the per-device
one) is in Documentation/ABI so we'll need to figure out how we are doing
to organize the files, e.g. just one big
Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-driver-intel-i915 file or multiple files
organized somehow. So let's do this as follow up.

Thanks.

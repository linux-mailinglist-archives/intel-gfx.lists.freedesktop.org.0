The results you got are certainly extremely attractive and the approach 
and code looks tidy and mature - just so you don't get me wrong that I 
am not objecting to the idea.

What I'd like to see is an easier to read breakdown of results, at 
minimum with separate perf and perf-per-Watt results. A graph with 
sorted results and error bars would also be nice.

Secondly in in the commit message of this particular patch I'd like to 
read some more thought about why ELSP[1] occupancy is thought to be the 
desired signal. Why for instance a deep ELSP[0] shouldn't benefit from 
more TDP budget towards the GPU and similar.

Also a description of the control processing "rf_qos" function do with 
this signal. What and why.

Some time ago we entertained the idea of GPU "load average", where that 
was defined as a count of runnable requests (so batch buffers). How 
that, more generic metric, would behave here if used as an input signal 
really intrigues me. Sadly I don't have a patch ready to give to you and 
ask to please test it.

Or maybe the key is count of runnable contexts as opposed to requests, 
which would more match the ELSP[1] idea.

But this is secondary, I primarily think we need to see a better 
presentation of the result and the theory of operation explained better 
in the commit message.

Tvrtko

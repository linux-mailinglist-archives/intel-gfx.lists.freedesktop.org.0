What I meant to say is to use the scheme of the damage control
not only to the global oom situation (on the global shortage of memory)
but also to the memcg oom situation (when the hard limit on a hierarchy
is reached).

Let me try to understand some more. So the game (or the entity to be
responsible for the resource) doesn't really allocate the memory but it
relies on somebody else (from memcg perspective living in a different
resource domain - i.e. a different memcg) to do that on its behalf.
Correct? If that is the case then that is certainly not fitting into the
memcg model then.
I am not really sure there is any reasonable model where you cannot
really tell who is responsible for the resource.

For shmem files the end user of the buffer can preallocate and so own
the buffer and be accounted for it.

The memory is accounted to whoever faults that memory in or to the
allocating context if that is a kernel memory (in most situations).

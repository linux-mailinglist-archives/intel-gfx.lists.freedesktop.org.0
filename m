A patch series was floated in the drm mailing list which aimed to change
the drm_connector and drm_encoder fields to pointer in the
drm_connector_writeback structure, this received a huge pushback from
the community but since i915 expects each connector present in the
drm_device list to be a intel_connector but drm_writeback framework
makes us have a connector which cannot be embedded in an intel_connector
structure.

Since no one had an issue with encoder field being changed into a
pointer it was decided to break the connector and encoder pointer
changes into two different series.The encoder field changes is
currently being worked upon by Abhinav Kumar and the changes have been
merged.

Going forward we use a drm_connector which is not embedded in
intel_connector. 
We also create a intel_encoder to avoid changes to many
iterators but no intel_connector. We also changed all iterators that
go through connectors and add a check to only cast connectors which are
not writeback connectors.
I had also floated a previous series to Enable writeback but floating a
new one as i created an extra patch in this series as suggested by
Jani, Nikula for intel_connector iterator changes.
Please go check the below link if interested.

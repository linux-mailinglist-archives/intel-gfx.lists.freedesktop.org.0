Is Option 2 above feasible since it would stop propagating the change to
various UMD's?

I was thinking more about UMD's which analayze OA data and who till now are
probably assuming OA freq == GT freq and will now have to drop that
assumption. So not sure how widespread would be these changes in
the (multiple different?) UMD(s).

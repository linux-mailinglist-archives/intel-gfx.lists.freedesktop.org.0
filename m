If this correction/compensation in the kernel works out, even for internal
too we could do the following:

* For non-mmaped case, do the correction in the kernel and expose OA freq
  == GT freq (in the getparam ioctl)
* For mmaped case expose the actual OA freq (!= GT freq)

This will restrict the divergence only to the mmaped case (which we will
probably not be able to upstream).

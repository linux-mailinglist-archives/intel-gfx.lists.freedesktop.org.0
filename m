Splitting hair a bit, but I am wondering if this is realistic? If reports
have been lost in the middle of a OA buffer then there /will/ be some data
from the hardware so head != tail. So is the situation which this patch is
fixing ever been observed in practice?

Also, if we are doing this, how about moving the entire status handling
here, including intel_uncore_read() and OABUFFER_OVERFLOW handling (which I
understand resets the stream so probably doesn't have associated data).

In any case, since these are just random questions, this is:

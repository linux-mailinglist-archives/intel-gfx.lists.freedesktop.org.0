I see that the story has mostly been unraveled by now elsewhere in the 
thread, and yes, upon some historical digging and looking at the code I 
agree that the name singleton is confusing/misleading.

And although race can happen and we can end up with more than one 
anonymous inode, I don't think there is any real harm which would 
warrant complicating this code further.

Perhaps a good enough solution would be to rename into something like 
i915->gem.cached_mmap_anon and put a comment above the smp_store_mb 
explaining that the race is unlikely but harmless. Because all i915 
needs is to decouple the file refcount from the DRM file, and whether it 
manages to do it with one anon file, or rarely slightly more than one, 
it doesn't really matter.

So if people agree, plan could be for you to proceed with the 
get_active_file fix and I can follow up with the rename and comment? 
Possibly at some later date so to avoid conflicts between the trees.

Tvrtko

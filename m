IMO we should be good to go. From my understanding, the problem that 
Lucas brings up doesn't yet have a solution other than WIP, so if we end 
up not being able to resize, we'd fall back to using the small BAR with 
Matthew's work.

That said, If we keep hitting errors when resizing, we should, as 
Christian says, compare with AMD (since they are not seeing this) and 
see what, if anything, can be done differently.

Thanks,

Thomas
